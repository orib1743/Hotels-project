# 🏨 Smart Price Comparison with Machine Learning

This project leverages **Machine Learning algorithms** to analyze, compare, and predict hotel prices across **Booking.com** and **Expedia**. By collecting and processing pricing data from both platforms, the model identifies patterns, trends, and potential pricing discrepancies, helping users find the best deals.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time Price Comparison** – Fetch and analyze prices from Booking and Expedia.
- **Predictive Pricing Model** – Uses ML algorithms to forecast price changes.
- **Data Analysis & Visualization** – Identify trends and insights with interactive graphs.
- **Automated Data Collection** – Scrapes and structures hotel pricing data for further analysis.

## 🔍 How It Works
1. **Data Collection** – Prices are gathered from Booking and Expedia via APIs or web scraping.
2. **Preprocessing** – The data is cleaned, normalized, and structured for ML models.
3. **Machine Learning Models** – Different regression and classification models analyze the pricing trends.
4. **Prediction & Recommendation** – The system predicts future prices and recommends the best booking time.
